# Deploying Your Website with AWS

## Introduction
Welcome to the cloud adventure! This project is all about taking your static website to new heights on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Buckle up as we embark on a journey to set up your site in the digital skies.

### Project Goals
1. Create a cozy spot for your website on an S3 bucket.
2. Boost content delivery speed with the magical CloudFront, ensuring a seamless user experience.
3. Learn how to delete your S3 bucket when needed.

## Adventure Plan

### 1. Create Your AWS Campsite
- Start by creating a public S3 bucket, your digital camping ground.
- Upload your website files into the bucket, like setting up your tent.

### 2. Secure Your Campsite with IAM Rangers
- Configure the S3 bucket for secure website hosting.
- Meet the IAM (Identity and Access Management) rangers to control access.

### 3. Light Up the Sky with CloudFront Fireworks
- Enter CloudFront, the firework show of AWS.
- Create a CloudFront distribution, connecting it to your S3 bucket â€“ the grand finale.

### 4. Enjoy the Starry Night at Your CloudFront Campsite
- Once CloudFront works its magic, get a unique CloudFront endpoint.
- Open your web browser like a virtual telescope and behold your website shining in the digital sky.

## Deleting Your AWS Campsite

### 1. Safely Pack Up Your Tent
- Before deleting, make sure your website files are safely backed up.
- Confirm that you no longer need the S3 bucket.

### 2. Delete Your AWS Campsite
- Head to the AWS S3 service.
- Locate your bucket and choose to delete it.
- Confirm the deletion â€“ your digital campsite will be cleared.

## Friendly Reminders
